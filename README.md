# Jupyter Community Activity

This repository is an experiment in collecting and visualizing recent activity
in the Jupyter communities. It covers several different GitHub organizations, as well
as the [Jupyter Community Forum](https://discourse.jupyter.org).

All analyses and visualizations are created with Jupyter Notebooks, and generated
as "reports" using [the papermill library](https://github.com/nteract/papermill).

The reports are [best viewed on nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/choldgraf/jupyter-activity-snapshot/blob/master/reports/). You'll see a few folders representing activity
in different moments in time. Click on the folder and then on the report that
you'd like to see.

**A caveat**: The data in these reports is just what could be (relatively) easily
scraped from the GitHub and Discourse APIs. That means we are missing a lot of really
important activity that is difficult to scrape automatically. Don't treat the numbers
in these reports as the total truth - they are just one view on the complex web of
activity that is the Jupyter community.
